# pec-reborn

A remaking of my previous repository that attempts to solve Project Euler challenges at the intersection between mathematics and coding.

Most likely I will not complete problems that I have already done on my [original repository](https://github.com/thedestroyer4312/project-euler-challenges).

## Languages

Python 3

## Usage

Problem solutions will be written in the most general format possible with specific problem answers applied to yield a specific solution printed to STDIN.
